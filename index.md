<h1>About Me</h1>

Hi ! My name is Li-Kai (Kevin) Chi. This website is intended to display my technical skill and accomplishments mainly in the fields of Data Science, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.   

I am currently an undergraduate student studying at University of Rochester. I am majoring Data Science (BS Degree) and minoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. This summer (summer of 2015), I am interning at the Institue of Information Sciene at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan.

As a data and AI enthusiast, I hope to focus my studies and work in these two areas in the future. In addition, I am currently looking for an internship in these two areas for the upcoming academic year (2015 - 2016) and the summer of 2016. Please feel free to contact me through email or LinkedIn for possible internship positions.
